ldesc: "The program gst123 is designed to be a more flexible command 
line player in the spirit of ogg123 and mpg123, based on gstreamer. It 
plays all file formats gstreamer understands, so if you have a music 
collection which contains different file formats, like flac, ogg and 
mp3, you can use gst123 to play all your music files."
